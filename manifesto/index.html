        <h4>1. GOOD DESIGN IS INNOVATIVE.</h4>
        <h3>
          The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.
          Technological development is always offering new opportunities for
          innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem
          with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

      <div id="second">
        <h4>2. GOOD DESIGN MAKES A PRODUCT USEFUL.</h4>
        <h3>
          A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria,
          not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design
          emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything
          that could possibly detract from it.

    <div id="container">
      <div id="third">
        <h4>3. GOOD DESIGN IS AESTHETIC.</h4>
        <h3>
          The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness
          because products we use every day affect our person and our
          well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div id="fourth">
        <h4>4. GOOD DESIGN MAKES A PRODUCT UNDERSTANDABLE.</h4>
        <h3>
          It clarifies the products structure. Better still, it can make the
          product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.
        </h3>
      </div>

    <div id="container">
      <div id="fifth">
        <h4>5. GOOD DESIGN IS UNOBTRUSIVE.</h4>
        <h3>
          Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither
          decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be
          both neutral and restrained, to leave room for the users
          self-expression.
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div id="sixth">
        <h4>6. GOOD DESIGN IS HONEST.</h4>
        <h3>
          It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable than
          it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with
          promises that cannot be kept.
        </h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="container">
      <div id="seventh">
        <h4>7. GOOD DESIGN IS LONG-LASTING.</h4>
        <h3>
          It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.
          Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years - even in today's
          throwaway society.
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div id="eigth">
        <h4>8. GOOD DESIGN IS THOROUGH DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL.</h4>
        <h3>
          Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the
          design process show respect towards the consumer.
        </h3>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="container">
      <div id="ninth">
        <h4>9. GOOD DESIGN IS ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY.</h4>
        <h3>
          Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the
          environment. It conserves resources and minimises physical and visual
          pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.
        </h3>
      </div>

      <div id="tenth">
        <h4>10. GOOD DESIGN IS AS LITTLE DESIGN AS POSSIBLE.</h4>
        <h3>
          Less, but better - because it concentrates on the essential aspects,
          and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity,
          back to simplicity.
